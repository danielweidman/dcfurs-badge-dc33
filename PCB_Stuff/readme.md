## PCB Information

As a policy, DEFCON Furs only makes public the schematic, board images and the Bill of Materials for the DEFCON Furs badges.   

The BoM can be viewed online: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jkg6oq2OzCKG4kRN5Ynu_qSia2YDe5dJ_6Gyr4F5ahs/edit?usp=sharing

PCBs for the prototype and After Dark versions of the badge were manufactured by OSHPark in Oregon and assembled by Kay in Seattle.
Black and assembled PCBs for sale to the public and DEFCON Furs staff badges were made by PCBWay in Shenzhen and assembled by PCBx.io in Ohio.

The files in the PCB_Stuff directory consist of:

- DCF2024 Badge_R1_Back.png - This is the back of the 1.0 badge as rendered by OSHPark.
DCF2024 Badge_R1_Front.png - This is the front of the 1.0 badge as rendered by OSHPark.
DCF2024-DC32-Badge-1.2.pdf - This is a PDF of the schematic.
DCFurs 2024 Badge BoM.xlsx - This is an Excel spreadsheet of the Bill of Materials as exported from Google Docs.

Whats missing:
- A better annotated version of the back of the badge, some parts are not clear in the current version (this will probably be a rendering of the 1.2 version that people got at DEF CON).
- KiCAD files, minus the board.
- Information about how to connect JTAG to the STM32WL chip.
